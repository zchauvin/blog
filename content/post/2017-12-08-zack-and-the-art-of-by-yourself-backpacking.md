# Zack and the Art of By-Yourself Backpacking

A beautiful summer's day in Venice. I exit the train, excited to spend my single day exploring the watery kingdom. A raindrop threatens to ruin the scene - perplexed, I discover that the precipitation is not coming from the perfect blue sky, but instead from my hiking backpack. Some frantic inspection reveals that a glass litre-bottle full of olive oil has smashed to bits in the midst of everything I own, dousing clothes and prized possessions alike. Why was I carrying olive oil? Why in a glass bottle? Why wasn't it at least wrapped in a plastic bag? All good questions without any good answers.

In the face of this calamity, I did the only thing I could - I threw back my head to the sky, and laughed. Laughed that I had been dumb enough to put glass and oil in my bag. Laughed that even though I was in Venice with hundreds of miles between me and anyone I knew, this was the biggest of my concerns. Laughed that while I would spend the entire day de-olive-oil-ifying my worldly possessions, I had the freedom to extend my stay in Venice to accommodate the setback. It was a beautiful moment that solidified the spirit of solo backpacking for me, but besides learning to roll with the punches, there are so many reasons to do a trip like this. My hope in this article is to convince you to solo backpack, and to make sure you know some of the things that I wish I knew. Not keeping a glass bottle of olive oil in your backpack is a good start.

### Why You Should Solo Backpack

I was initially skeptical about solo backpacking. I had only travelled alone once before, and after only a day in Amsterdam wandering the streets, I found myself wishing I had others with me to share the sights and experiences of the city.

This most recent trip was actually inspired by that experience, because I wanted to challenge my myself to see if I could enjoy making my own way through Europe. Within a week of starting my solo adventure, it was already clear to me why people who commit to this form of travel love it so much. Here are a couple of the biggest reasons to strike out alone:

**You'll save a ton of money.** All of the core costs of backpacking are incredibly cheap. Hostels start at $14/night (all prices in this post are in USD), groceries can be $15/day, and inter-city buses start at $20, meaning your base cost per day can reasonably be as low as $50 (this assumes you move cities every 4 days). From there, you can optionally choose to eat out, take nicer or more frequent transportation, or visit paid attractions. No matter how you choose to optimize your budget, you'll be able to keep costs low while experiencing a wide variety of places and cultures.

**You'll adventure with people of greatly diverse backgrounds.** In my travels, the people I explored, ate and lived with were from 6 different continents, spoke countless different languages, came from incredibly varying socio-economic backgrounds, and had every job under the sun. I talked to people who worked long hours at minimum-wage jobs so they could leave it all behind to travel the world, and heard about people's dreams of becoming musicians or mathematicians. Youth hostels are a truly global community of people from all walks of life, and being a part of that culture is an invaluable experience.

**You'll learn to listen to yourself and do what it is you actually want to do.** So much of typical vacationing is visiting some monument because you feel like you should or doing an activity simply because you trip-mates are doing it. With solo backpacking, all of that falls away. Each morning, you wake up and decide what you want to do with almost no limitations. Skip town and take a train into the mountains? Spend an entire day reading by a river? Get lost in the narrow streets of a medieval quarter? Traveling alone forces you to critically evaluate what it is you enjoy doing while abroad, and gives you the freedom to do just that.

**You'll gain confidence in befriending and adventuring with total strangers.** Jumping from hostel to hostel means that you'll constantly be thrown into a new community and you'll have the opportunity to find new people with which to explore the city. Luckily, virtually everyone around you is trying to do the same thing, and I became much more confident in sitting down to eat with strangers, or chatting up a new friend on the street.  

### My Trip

To give you some context, I'll speak briefly about my trip. The solo backpacking portion of my summer was 38 days long and covered 14 cities in 8 countries, which worked out to about 2 or 3 nights in most cities. I went south to north in Central Europe, then flew to Italy and headed north through the Alps to Paris, and ended my trip with a flight to Iceland. I almost always stayed in hostels, spent most of my time visiting city attractions or hiking. To get a sense of what I saw, check out my [trip photo album](https://www.facebook.com/zack.chauvin.7/media_set?set=a.10155822836409914.1073741832.733359913&type=3) or the solo backpacking section of my [trip spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hlLUlscvOoQPh2sKc2cw24ZQSPwKm6NIynWH2ipIv4M/edit#gid=0).

### Planning Your Adventure

I mentioned that you'll learn a lot about yourself through this trip, and even before I left, I learned something important. I hate planning for trips. The thought of trying to decide what I'll want to do months in the future and thousands of miles away fills me with dread. Luckily for me, and perhaps for you, backpacking requires very little planning. Despite that, here are a few things that you will want to think about as you prepare:

**Think about how far in advance you want to solidify plans.** Personally, I was very comfortable leaving my plans completely open. In each city, I had little idea when I'd leave and where I'd be going next. With most forms of travel, you get punished financially for not planning ahead, but luckily bus and hostel prices are relatively stable with respect to when you book. This allowed me to ask around for recommendations, stay in cities that I loved longer, coordinate with others staying at my hostels and be flexible when all my belongings became soaked in olive oil. On the other hand, this meant that every couple of days I had to re-evaluate my trip and figure out what to do next. If this sounds stressful and you'd rather get all the planning out of the way up front, that's quite common as well.

**Leverage the wonderful world of apps.** Whether you decide to plan ahead of time or on the ground, you'll want to check out two apps that make finding great attractions easy. The first, Trip Advisor, you likely already know and love for their huge database of tourist sites and reviews. Another one to check out which is less well-known in Google Trips. In true Google form, it has a beautiful user interface and plays nicely with other Google-family apps like Maps. These two apps give you a couple of ideas to get started with in any city, and from there you should find less-visited sites by exploring on your own or using other resources like the [NY Times 36 Hours Guides](https://www.nytimes.com/column/36-hours).

**Consider traveling with data.** In order to take advantage of apps like Google Trips, you should think about whether or not you'll travel with data. Many backpacking destinations like the EU have extremely cheap data (e.g. EU-wide pre-paid data for <$15/month), and I personally felt it was worth getting in order to have access to guides, translation dictionaries, maps and emergency services. This is certainly a trade-off, as constant internet access does take away some of the adventure of being in a foreign country.

**Beat the hoards of tourists.** If you're not careful about your planning, you may end up spending a considerable portion of your trip waiting in line. Consider traveling in a shoulder season, which varies by country but is typically late spring or early fall. Additionally, you'll want to avoid the biggest attractions during midday, as their lines will be much more manageable early in the day or closer to dinner. Lastly, for the most sought-after attractions like the Coliseum or St. Peter's Basilica, consider buying a skip-the-line pass online, which can save you upwards of an hour for just a few euros.

### Making the Most of Hostels

Hostels may be the best part of solo backpacking, as they provide strong community, entertainment, lodging and more for an affordable price. In order to make them work for you, check out the following tips.

**Find out what type of hostel you enjoy the most.** A glance at a hostel-finding service like [Hostel World](https://www.hostelworld.com/) will make it clear that hostels are incredibly diverse, but a good way to consider them is where they fall on the rustic to fancy spectrum. On the rustic end, you have your small, mom-and-pop hostel with very basic amenities, while on the fancy end, you have your large, clean-cut hostel chains with all sorts of bells and whistles (e.g. a public bar/cafe, hip wall art, and door keycards). Surprisingly, the rustic hostels are not much cheaper than the large, fancy hostels, but I still preferred the former as I found the combination of fewer guests and simpler amenities to foster a stronger community.

**Try out hostels before committing to them.** Depending on where and when you go, hostels will have availability each night, allowing you to be flexible with your reservations. While I was still trying to figure out what I liked in a hostel, I would only book one or two nights even if I thought I'd end up in that city for longer. If I liked the hostel and the city, I'd extend it, and if I didn't I could move elsewhere. In rare cases, there may be no availability when you go to extend, so try to ask ahead of time what there occupancy level is like.

**You will lose everything**. Well, you'll lose everything if you don't keep your stuff together. If you have anything that you need to have apart for your stuff temporarily (e.g. to dry something on a sill), set an alarm for the morning as a reminder. When you're leaving, put all your possessions in the hallway and do a final sweep of the room to track down forgotten items.

**Consider treating yourself to a private room.** While you may be excited about the prospect of sleeping in the same room as up to 15 other people, it can become a little taxing. With snorers, late-night talkers, and hoards of bathroom-sharers being the chief amenities of dorms, a private rooms starting at $40 every once in awhile can shake things up.

### Becoming a Social Butterfly

If you're anything like me and therefore still in the social caterpillar stage, the thought of trying to make new friendships with people in a foreign city each day may sound exhausting. It certainly is a challenge, but luckily the trip is oriented around places and activities that facilitate that sort of connection. Here are a couple strategies for getting to know your fellow backpackers.

**Cook dinner at your hostel as much as possible.** Spending a few hours cooking and eating with other travelers is a great way to get to know them. At each hostel, I would initially cook for myself and potentially make more to share, but after becoming friends with others who were cooking as well, we'd often all make a meal together in subsequent days. I met most of my traveling friends in this way, and to that end, a communal kitchen was something that I always looked for in hostels.

**Offer to take pictures for other tourists.** Ideally you'd be doing this out of the kindness of your heart anyways, but I found this to be a great way of meeting people. While I've always wanted to be one of those people who can strike up a conversation with strangers, this was a little cheat that eventually made me more confident doing it in other contexts. Additionally, as a solo traveler this may save you from at least a couple selfies as your new friend will likely offer to take a picture of you in return.

**Meet people through walking tours and pub crawls.** I was very pleasantly surprised by how social the free walking tours in European cities can be. They were full of solo travelers like myself who were looking for people with which to adventure, and often we'd chat on the tour about places we wanted to visit and go immediately after. If you're looking for more of a party vibe and you're willing to pretend you're back in college, then pub crawls may be for you. Most big cities in Central Europe have very affordable public pub crawls every night of the week.

### Advice That Doesn't Fit Cleanly Into a Category

**Bring the essentials.** Here are a couple things that you may not think to bring but you'll be glad to have:
- *A small padlock.* Most hostels have a locker with a ring for a padlock where you can keep your valuables.
- *A headlamp.* Very helpful for packing in a dorm when others are sleeping.
- *Pack towel.* A lightweight towel that dries quickly as otherwise you'll have to pay for a towel at each hostel.
- *Earplugs.* These will save you from the snore orchestra present in most hostel dorms.
- *A pelican case.* These waterproof, indestructible [cases](http://www.pelican.com/) are great for protecting your electronics and other valuables.

**Charge your electronics whenever you can.** Especially if you're traveling with data, your battery life is a resource that you'll have to plan around if you're not careful. Unfortunately, charging in hostels can be a little tricky because you shouldn't leave valuables unattended. Instead, charge during whatever down-time you have like cooking and eating. Additionally, some of the nicer hostels have plugs right beside your pillow in your bunk, in which case overnight charging is feasible.

**Check out passes for transit and attractions.** If you suspect you'll be using public transport a lot in a particular city, a day or week pass is almost always worth it. Additionally, some cities have combined passes like the Roma Pass which gets you unlimited public transit and free access to many tourist attractions. These can be fairly pricy, and are likely only worth it if you know you're interested in a bunch of paid sites.

**Save your change.** Small coins are incredibly useful while traveling. Perhaps most importantly, you'll need them to use the washroom in public places. Additionally, they're often convenient for paying quickly for public transit and around the hostel they have many uses from paying for laundry to buying a drink at the cafe.

### Awards

If you're looking for some inspiration as to where you might want to backpack, here are some awards that will point you in the right direction.

#### Coolest Places
- *Berlin.* If hipsters could design a city, they'd design Berlin. Featuring incredible street art, a rich connection to its history, beautiful green spaces and very hip neighborhoods, Berlin is completely different than anything you'll see elsewhere.
- *The Swiss Alps.* I literally wept when I woke up on my train and found myself in a Swiss mountain valley. The combination of incredibly lush valleys, snow-capped peaks, and quaint Swiss towns really can't be beat, but be warned - it's even more expensive than you'd expect.
- *Florence.* As someone who's lukewarm on art at best, I was surprised by how much I loved Florence. Home to breathtaking pieces like Michelangelo's David and the Gates of Paradise as well as medieval quarters steeped in Italian history, it's an endlessly entertaining city no matter what you're in to.

#### Nicest Hostels
- *Hostel Ruthensteiner, Vienna.* This place has it all - extremely low rates, a private bar and piano lounge, a nice communal kitchen and a beautiful outdoor patio. All of this comes together to form a close community that's tough to leave.
- *Le Flâneur Guesthouse, Lyon.* While this place is on the larger and fancier side of things, the staff plans plenty of activities to help people get to know each other. It also features a huge indoor social space and a nice patio.
- *Europahütte, Zermatt.* Just one of many amazing huts in the Swiss Alps, this one is right in the middle of an incredible two day hike, the Europaweg. As part of your board, you'll get an amazing dinner and a continental breakfast, and the occupancy is the right size to foster a great community of hikers.

#### Best Off-the-Beaten-Path Attractions
- *Capuchin Bone Crypt, Rome.* This amazing site is easily lost in the sea of cool things to do in Italy's capital, but it's a sight unlike any other. Built with the bones of 3700 Capuchin monks, it's at once disturbing, beautiful and thought-provoking.
- *Glymur Waterfall Hike, Iceland.* Despite being an incredibly accessible hike, this outing features a log and wire river crossing, a climb up a beautiful 650' waterfall and views down a lush river valley.
- *The Alternative Berlin Tours.* Trying to design a classically uncool activity like a walking tour for a city that lives and breathes cool is a real challenge, but this company walks the line brilliantly. I would highly recommend both their free Street Art Tours which give you the city's history through its vibrant street art culture, and the "Anti Pubcrawl", which is a small-group crawl with much chiller bars than your typical event.
